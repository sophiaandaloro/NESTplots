# NESTplots
This code is here to show the process of performing computations for benchmark plots. 
get_images.py uses Flask to view each image saved in URL form, for later implementation of updating these plots automatically.
To run everything, just run get_images.py, and go to localhost:5000 with the correct arguments for whatever image you're looking to see.
